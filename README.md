## How To Enable WebGL in Chrome

If you are using Chrome and you cannot see the Scene, you need to check if WebGL is enabled in your browser or not. 
Follow these steps:

1. Open a Chrome browser window.
2. Type or paste "chrome://settings/system" into the address bar.
3. Ensure that the "Use hardware acceleration when available" checkbox is checked. If it's not checked, enable it.
4. Relaunch Chrome.

Now WebGL should be enabled in your Chrome browser, and you should be able to see the Scene in the NovoRender App.

-- You can also run the App in the new Microsoft Edge without issues.
